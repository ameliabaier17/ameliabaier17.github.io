            <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 0px;">Figure 1. This plot shows an interactive donut chart of top 30 words describing data analysis responsibilities.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; "> It is unsurprising that the most frequent word in data 
                analysis job descriptions is "data". Other key words that stand out include 
                "business", "support", "processes", "management", "reports", "quality", and 
                "customer". These words suggest that data analysts use data to support the 
                business needs of their customers, which may involve tasks such as drafting 
                reports, performing quality control over various data processes, and sometimes 
                even becoming involved in the management of teams and projects.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 0px;">Figure 2. This plot shows an interactive donut chart of top 30 words describing data science responsibilities.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Although there are some words in this chart that overlap with 
                the responsibilities of a data analyst, there are also key differences that set data 
                scientists apart. For instance, words such as "development", "models", "learning", 
                "techniques", "predictive", "statistical", and "algorithms" do not frequently appear 
                in the list of data analyst responsibilities. These words highlight the unique responsibilities of 
                data scientists in terms of development of predictive machine learning models and algorithms, 
                and use of statistical techniques to draw insights and information for their projects 
                and teams. </p>

    <div class="cell">
		<iframe src="../images/donut_chart3.html" style="width: 60%; height: 110%; margin: 0; padding: 50px 0 50px 100px;"></iframe>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 0px;">Figure 3. This plot shows an interactive donut chart 
                of top 30 words describing machine learning responsibilities.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Again, overlap between the responsibilities of data science and machine 
            learning job types exist. However, "learning" is the word with the highest frequency in this chart, 
            which highlights the main focus of machine learning: learning how to find the optimal interaction between 
            data and machines. Other words such as "technical", "design", "engineering", "build", 
            "software", "code", and "research" also stand out. These words suggest that machine learning 
            roles may be more technical in nature, falling more frequently under the title of machine 
            learning engineer, and having responsibilities such as conducting research, building and 
            designing code using various software tools to create machine learning models.</p>
