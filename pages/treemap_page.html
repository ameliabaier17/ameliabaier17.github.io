            <p  style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 60px;">
                Let's explore the qualifications required for a data analyst role. 
                The treemap reveals key words such as "experience", "year", "data",
                 "communication", "management", "statistics", "SQL", and "Excel". 
                 These words suggest that a data analyst role requires a few years 
                 of experience working with data, effective communication skills to 
                 work with teams and clients, and some management experience. Moreover, 
                 hard skills such as statistics, SQL, and Excel are crucial to have 
                 a background in if applying to data analysis roles.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 60px;">
                This treemap highlights key qualifications for data science roles. Words such as "statistics", "machine learning",
and "mathematics" underscore the importance of having strong quantitative skills. Additionally, proficiency in
tools such as "Python" and "R" are considered essential for most data science positions; this is expected 
as we saw that responsibilities include the development of predictive algorithms and models. The word, "sql" is 
also seen here which is not surprising as some companies require data scientists to use query search engines 
in which knowdlege of sql is important.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 60px;">
                The treemap displays qualifications necessary for a data science role, 
                with some unique words that stand out such as "learning," "engineering," 
                "deep," and "software." These suggest that familiarity with software 
                engineering and deep learning is required. Additionally, "pytorch" and 
                "tensorflow" are highlighted as essential python libraries for developing 
                advanced machine learning models, so knowledge and experience with these are 
                crucial for machine learning roles.</p>
