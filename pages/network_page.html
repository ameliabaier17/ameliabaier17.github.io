            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Figure 8. This plot shows an interactive network graph of the relationships between job types and company names.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">This network graph has many layers for observation. By clicking on the blue nodes, you can see they 
                 represent data analysis, data science and machine learning job types and all have multiple edges connected to various 
                company names. The majoriyt of companies are connected to only one of the three nodes, which gives a sense 
                that their description of those roles may overlap between all three job types as opposed to companies such as Walmart and Deloitte
                that have edges connected to multiple job types gives me a sense they have distinct responsibilities or departments 
                laid out for each role. A student can uncover more concise information about these relationships by taking advantage 
                of the filter. For instance, edges with specific weights might be helpful in understanding the volume 
                of roles a company is offering for a job type(s). For example, i can select the max edge weight value and observe 
                that Walmart appears to have 8 roles under the data analysis job type. This makes sense as Walmart is 
                not considered a tech company but has many clients and business needs where data anlysts would be extremely 
                useful. A student can also filter by a company of interest. For example, a student may be interested in Facebook 
                and filter to that company. When doing so, it's apparent that from the web crawling results, they are offering 
                a machine learning role; logical given that Facebook is a top tech company with a focus on advanced machine learning 
                algorithms to deploy for their clients. Overall, there are many companies out there looking to hire in data analysis, 
                data science and machine learning.
