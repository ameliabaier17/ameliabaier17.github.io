            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Figure 11. This plot shows an interactive network graph of the relationships between job types (blue nodes represent data analysis, data science and machine learning) and company names (green nodes).</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                By interacting with the plot in various ways such as clicking on specific nodes to see titles more 
                clearly, moving nodes around, and utilizing the filter options, there are many aspects of analysis. 
            
                 Most companies are connected to only one of the three job types, while some 
                 companies like Walmart and Deloitte have edges connected to multiple job types, 
                 implying distinct responsibilities or departments for each role. This opens up
                  opportunities for cross-collaboration between departments for students who are 
                  interested in experiencing all data science and machine learning roles.

                  The filter function provides specific information about these relationships, such as the 
                  volume of job roles offered by each company for a specific job type.  For instance, by 
                selecting the max edge weight value, it is apparent that Walmart has eight 
                roles under the data analysis job type. This make sense as 
                Walmart's many clients and extensive business operations generate a large 
                amount of data that needs to be analyzed for insights, making data analysts 
                a valuable resource for the company. Additionally, one can filter by a company 
                of interest, such as Google, and reveal which job roles they might be hiring more of. For instance, 
                Google is offering a machine learning role, and no data analysis/data science roles, which 
                is no surprise given the large amount of their products that focus on 
                advanced machine learning algorithms such as google translate and Google Search. Without more 
                information on the type of industry associated with each company, it is 
                challenging to determine if one industry dominates in certain roles. However, a logical 
                next step would be subdiving networks by location to understand if any industry trends 
                can be observed geographically and by job type.
