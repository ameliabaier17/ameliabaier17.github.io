            <p style="font-size: 16px; ">Figure 8. This plot shows an interactive chlorpleth map of data analysis roles across 
                the US. Data was filtered to US results with a non-remote status and 
            a single location as opposed to "United States" or "New York + 12 cities".</p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px; padding-bottom: 100px;" > Most students must decide whether to look for jobs in their 
                local area or explore opportunities outside of their state. While many web
                 crawling results for US-based data analysis roles were remote or located in the United
                  States, we can still draw insights from the small sample size that shows data analysis 
                  roles without a remote option and a single location are predominantly in the Midwest. 
                  This might be surprising at first, but according to an article by A.M. Titan Group 
                  published in February 2023, the Midwest has seen significant growth in tech jobs due
                   to factors like affordable cost of living and lower salaries <sup>[1]</sup>. Additionally, Forbes 
                   has dubbed the Midwest as the "Silicon Prairie" in an article titled "Why The Midwest 
                   Is Becoming A Thriving Hub For Fintechs," indicating the direction the region is headed <sup>[2]</sup>.

                science roles across the US from the US web crawling results. Data was filtered to results with a non-remote status and 
                a single location as opposed to "United States" or "New York + 12 cities".</p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Looking at states that have higher concentrations of data science roles, Texas has the highest. This is not 
        surprising as tech jobs have been growing significantly in Texas. For instance, CompTIA's annual "State of the Tech Workforce" reveals that net tech employment1 
        grew by 5.5% in Texas in 2022. Additionally,has a 
        concentration of companies in the energy, finance, and healthcare industries, which tend to have a 
        higher demand for data science as well as data analysis roles.<sup>[3]</sup>. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Figure 10. This plot shows an interactive chlorpleth map of machine learning roles across the US from the US web crawling results.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">This chloropleth displays that job titles found from the web crawling results 
             have a higher concentration 
            of opportunies on the west coast and northeast. Many reasons could explain this, however, one potential
            explantation could be because California, Washington and New York are home to some of the 
            largest tech companies in the world, such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and 
            Microsoft, all of which are heavily invested in machine learning. </p>
