            <p style="font-size: 22px;"> Most students must make a decision to look for jobs in their local area 
                or to explore outside of their state. Out of the web crawling results for the US, we saw that a very high 
                portion of them were remote or had locations set to "United States". As a result, we were left with a small 
                sample size. However, we can still draw insight from these queries that the majority of data analysis roles 
                not offering a remote option and do not have multiple locations (as those were not included here), are predominatly in the 
                midwest.

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Figure 8. This plot shows an interactive chlorpleth map of data analysis roles across the US from the US web crawling results.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px;"> Looking at states that have higher concentrations of data science roles (not offering 
            a remote option and do not have multiple locations listed), Texas has the highest. This is not 
        surprising as tech jobs have been growing in Texas. For instance, CompTIA's annual "State of the Tech Workforce" reveals that net tech employment1 
        grew by 5.5% in Texas in 2022. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 22px;">This chloropleth displays that job titles found from the web crawling results 
            (not offering a remote option and do not have multiple locations listed) are commonly found in California. 
            This is also not surpring as Silicon Valley is located in CA where the world's largest high-tech corporations and 
            thousands of tech start up companies can be found.</p>
