                <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 0px;">Figure 7. This interactive sankey diagram shows the distribution of job titles in data analysis, data science 
                    and machine learning by remote status.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-top: 0px;">A large impact COVID-19 had on the employment industry was the acceptance and encouragement of remote work.
                    65% of respondents in FlexJobs’ Career Pulse Survey conducted during summer 2022
                     expressed their desire to work remotely full-time, while 32% said they prefer a hybrid work environment <sup>[1]</sup>.
                     Today, applicants have to consider whether they want a hybrid, in person, or fully remote job. 
                     Therefore, using this sankey diagram to understand the breakdown of job opportunities based on their 
                     remote status becomes relevant. The digram shows that the majority of opportunities are not remote, 
                     indicating that companies still see the value
                     being in the office can have; more collabroation and communication, enhancced team building and 
                     and company cultre, etc. However, there is a relatively even split in remote vs non-remote opportunities
                    for roles in data analysis as opposed to the very uneven split seen in machine learning roles. One possible reason for this 
                     may be because specific machine learning roles involve working with big/complex data 
                     that may require special comuting resources not able to be set up at home.
